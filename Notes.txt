- Modify clientgui.json to change the GUI.
- clientgui.json "image" only allows *.gif file
- Rules on creating custom modules:
    - Make sure that you place it in /components folder
    - Name the python file as the same name as the class inside
        e.g. "Test.py" will contain "class Test:"
    - Include a .Run() method inside your class. This will run every 120 seconds when the mirror is active
    - When including other modules in .Run(), make the path as you would coding from root folder
        e.g. Instead of using "import test" if "test.py" is in the same folder, use "from components import test"
    - When using Standard, make sure to run .Commit() to make changes to clientgui.json
